Since I was a teenager, I have had an interest in advertising. In my opinion the professional areas, which combine two different subjects are the most engaging and prominent. For instance, in advertising those subjects are art and marketing. Thus, I got Specialist’s degree in Advertising. After graduation in 2011, I started my career as a junior account manager in the client service department of an international advertising agency. 

During my first year of working there I learnt that an account manager position requires such skills as communication and management skills, as well as technical and creative skills as engagement and understanding of the tasks completed across multiple departments is essential.

Technology plays a key role in marketing and sales, I have been involved in numerous digital projects, which I have found to be the most exciting and diverse ones among all others. In July 2016 I changed my employers and moved to a digital agency as a senior account manager. The major focus of my current employer is web site, mobile application and e-detailing development, as well as digital strategy planning. My present work includes interaction with the internal technical department and production partner companies. I started noticing that my favourite part of the working day is asking tech team heaps of questions about how they built this and that. Way more questions than any client would ever ask, I should say. My colleagues are indulgent! In the past year I have realised that I am more interested in being able to build and bring products to life myself, rather than only managing a process from client’s perspective.

That is why in August 2016 I completed a “Web development for beginners” course at Moscow Coding School. After that I had no doubts I want to learn programming and that I was ready to invest as such time and effort as needed. I found out about Flatiron School via one of Casey Neistat’s vlogs with Karlie Kloss. 

I was amazed by how connected and supportive students who do online course all over the world are regardless possible cultural or time differences. It is astonishing that myself from Moscow can help out someone from a small town in USA. Or that a guy from Johannesburg and I can do pair coding while both sitting at our places. I feel very lucky to be part of this community.
