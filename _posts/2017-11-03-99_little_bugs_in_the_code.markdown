When I found out about the book "The Mythical Man-Month" written by Frederick Brooks there were couple of things which astonished me the most. First of all the fact that it was written in 1975. In that book Brooks presented several ideas, which are very relevant to this day. More than forty years have pasted and people still are facing the exactly same problems in their tech projects. 

Based on his professional experience at IBM Fred Brooks explains the importance of such things as communication inside the team; creating formal documentation; schedule monitoring; explains misconception between effort and progress; best ways of allocation of responsibilities, and many others. He also provides with good reasoning and examples. 

For instance, why it is not a good idea to handle schedule slips by adding more people. In fact it will only magnify the problem, as they would need to be recruited, trained by more experienced current developer, plus even in this case it cannot be guaranteed that only one milestone was misestimated and that will not happen again in the future.

Smarter thing to do would be honestly rescheduling the project plan to ensure that the work can be carefully and thoroughly done with no more rescheduling in the future. If the deadline cannot be postponed under any circumstances, another alternative path would be to trim the task. 

Another thing I learnt and which I find extremely comforting as a beginner is that, no matter how experienced you are, and how many times have you done the similar task before, you cannot predict all bugs and challenges you are going to face. Brooks says, that all programmers are optimists. And that they tend to estimate less time than needed, because ***all will go well, each task will hike only as long as it ‘ought’ to take.*** Which unfortunately is not true most of the times.
> The programmer builds from pure thought-stuff: concepts and very flexible representations thereof. Because the medium is tractable, we expect few difficulties in implementation; hence our pervasive optimism. Because our ideas are faulty, we have bugs; hence our optimism is unjustified.

I would recommend to read "The Mythical Man-Month" to anyone who is related to technologies and teamwork. Obviously it is easier to say than to follow all those concepts. However if everyone will try and implement at least one of them to their day-to-day professional life, I believe  it will make work more enjoyable and less stressful.
